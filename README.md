A minimal mode to write story or stuff on an off-line web page and then just save it as html file when you done. Some key text formatings are provided, url link, picture, video. The picture will set to width:100% in the saved html file. And the default file name will be the Date.now() timestamp. This thing uses quill.js xdev_b.js libraries but maybe will copy a function from xdev_b.js into the write.html itself so we can elimimate dependency with xdev_b.js soon.

Thanks to the quill.js team, they did good work.
